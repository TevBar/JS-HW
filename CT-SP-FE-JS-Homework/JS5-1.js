//! Content: Algos and intermediate DSA, Searching, linked lists etc

// Reading: None, feel free to peruse the rest of the book as you please

// HW: 
//* 1. Reverse the list below in-place using an in-place algorithm.
// For extra credit: Reverse the strings at the same time.
// words = ['this' , 'is', 'a', 'sentence', '.']
// # Output: words = ['.', 'ecnetnes', 'a', 'si', 'sith']

//* 2. Create a function that counts how many distinct words are in the string 
// * below, then outputs a dictionary with the words as the key and the value 
//* as the amount of times that word appears in the string.
// Should output:
// {'a': 5,
// 'abstract': 1,
// 'an': 3,
// 'array': 2, ... etcâ€¦
//! Input: 
let a_text = 'In computing, a hash table hash map is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found'


//* 4.  Write a program to implement a Linear Search Algorithm. 
//* Also in a comment, write the Time Complexity of the following algorithm.
